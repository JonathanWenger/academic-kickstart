title: "ProbNum: Probabilistic Numerics in Python"
summary: "Probabilistic Numerics (PN) interprets classic numerical routines as inference procedures by taking a probabilistic viewpoint. This allows principled treatment of uncertainty arising from finite computational resources. The vision of probabilistic numerics is to provide well-calibrated probability measures over the output of a numerical routine, which then can be propagated along the chain of computation."
